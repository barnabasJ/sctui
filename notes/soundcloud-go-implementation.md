# SoundCloud TUI with Go SoundCloud API - Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Build a SoundCloud TUI client using the `github.com/zackradisic/soundcloud-api` Go library, which provides access to SoundCloud's undocumented API v2 without requiring official API credentials.

## Solution Overview
Use the reverse-engineered SoundCloud API library to build a legitimate TUI client with:
- Search functionality for tracks, artists, and playlists
- Track metadata retrieval and display
- Audio streaming with progress controls
- Playlist management
- Modern TUI interface with Bubble Tea

## Legal Considerations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses SoundCloud's undocumented internal API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May violate SoundCloud's Terms of Service
- ‚úÖ No official API credentials required
- ‚úÖ Open source educational implementation
- üìù Users assume responsibility for ToS compliance

## Current Status (December 2025)

**‚úÖ Working:** Complete TUI application with search and navigation
**üöß Next:** Real audio playback implementation 
**üéØ Goal:** Functional SoundCloud music player

**How to Run:**
```bash
# Build the TUI (uses Makefile)
make build

# Run the interactive TUI
./bin/sctui

# Or run example search (CLI mode)
make run

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Use Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate views
# Search for tracks in Search view
# Select tracks to load in Player view
# Player shows UI but doesn't play audio yet
```

**What You'll See:**
- Modern TUI with Search/Player/Queue tabs
- Search functionality with track results
- Player interface with progress bar and controls
- Volume controls with emoji indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts: Tab (next view), Space (play/pause), +/- (volume)

**Missing Piece:** Real audio playback (Step 5 implementation)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setup and Basic Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add soundcloud-api dependency
- [x] Create SoundCloud client wrapper
- [x] Test basic track info retrieval
- [x] Verify search functionality works
- [x] Build working CLI with search and track info commands
- [x] Add comprehensive ToS disclaimer
- [x] Test real SoundCloud API integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ Working CLI can search tracks and display metadata

**Current Functionality:**
```bash
# Search for tracks
./sctui -search "lofi hip hop"

# Get track information  
./sctui -track "https://soundcloud.com/artist/track"

**Status**: ‚úÖ TUI Framework Complete - Audio Implementation Needed

**What Works:**
- Complete TUI interface with Search/Player/Queue views
- Navigation with Tab/Shift+Tab between views
- Search functionality with track selection
- Player component with mock audio controls
- Volume controls with visual feedback (üîáüîâüîä)
- Progress bar with Unicode block characters
- Track metadata display with text truncation
- State management and error handling

**Current Limitation:**

## Success Criteria
- Can search and play SoundCloud tracks
- Responsive TUI with intuitive controls
- Stable audio playback without interruptions
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Clear documentation for users

## Risk Mitigation
1. **API Stability**: SoundCloud may change internal APIs
   - *Mitigation*: Monitor library updates, have fallback plans
   
2. **Terms of Service**: Using undocumented APIs
   - *Mitigation*: Clear user disclaimers, educational purpose
   
3. **Rate Limiting**: Potential API throttling
   - *Mitigation*: Implement request caching and delays

## User Disclaimer
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

This application uses SoundCloud's undocumented internal API 
through a reverse-engineered Go library. This may violate 
SoundCloud's Terms of Service.

By using this software, you acknowledge:
- This is for educational/personal use only
- You assume full responsibility for ToS compliance
- The functionality may break if SoundCloud changes their API
- Consider supporting artists through official channels

Use at your own discretion and risk.
```

This approach allows us to build a functional SoundCloud TUI while being transparent about the legal considerations and technical limitations.

## Test-Driven Development Methodology

This project follows TDD principles for better code quality and design:

### TDD Cycle for Each Feature
1. **Write failing tests** - Define expected behavior first
2. **Write minimal code** - Make tests pass with simplest implementation  
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - Continue for next feature or improvement

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and methods
- **Component Tests**: TUI components and their interactions
- **Integration Tests**: SoundCloud API integration and audio streaming
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows

### Test Structure

### Benefits of TDD Approach
- ‚úÖ **Better Design**: Tests force thinking about interfaces first
- ‚úÖ **Higher Quality**: Catches bugs early in development cycle
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- ‚úÖ **Confidence**: Safe refactoring with comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Debugging**: Tests help isolate and fix issues quickly
